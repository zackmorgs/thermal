I haven't coded in C++ in a while, so this is me messing around with it for the first time in like 5 years. 

## Project Goals
- fast http/https server
- SPA-ready
- hot-reload capability 
- easy REST api integration?

### Instructions
- Install cmake:
    - `choco install cmake`
- Clone the repo
- Compile it:
    - `cd ./build; cmake --build .`
